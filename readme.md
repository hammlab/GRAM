# GRAM: Geodesic Registration on Anatomical Manifolds

### What is GRAM?
GRAM  is a framework for groupwise registration of medical images, described in the paper by *Hamm, Ye, Verma, and Davatzikos*, [MedIA 2010](http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~hammj/papers/media10jh.pdf).

### Why use GRAM?
####Challenges in medical image registration
The goal of registering medical images is to find biologically plausible transformations between two images or from a template to multiple images. For the two images such as T1-weighted brain MRIs to have anatomical one-to-one correspondence after registration, the transformation has to be topology-preserving (i.e., diffeomorphic). However, when two images differ greatly in shape, it is difficult to find a topology-preserving transformation algorithmically.
####Geodesic registration on the manifold of diffeomorphism
Several approaches such as LDDMM (Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping) have been proposed to remedy this problem. These methods provide mathematically solid solutions to the large-deformation registration problems, by finding geodesic paths of transformations on the manifold of diffeomorphisms. However, such transformations are computationally very costly to compute. Ever more importantly, such mathematically-defined transformations may not coincide with biologically plausible transformations between real brain anatomies.
####Geodesic registration on anatomical manifolds
Ideally we want to calculate geodesics on the manifold of transformations that represent only the biologically relevant variations. However, such manifold cannot be represented analytically.
GRAM is a registration framework toward this goal. The key idea of GRAM is that we approximate analytical geodesic paths with finite sequences of small deformations observed in the actual anatomies in data. In another point-of-view, we are constructing empirical manifolds from data, a technique known as manifold learning, instead of dealing with an analytical manifold of diffeomorphisms. In particular we borrow an idea from Isomap algorithm Tenenbaum et al. (2000), which replace the geodesic path of the analytical manifold by the shortest path on a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) graph that approximates the metric structure of the empirical manifold. 

###What GRAM is not
GRAM is not an algorithm to register two images. It is a framework for registering a large number of images to a group template. GRAM uses any pairwise registration algorithm as an interchangeable component. In this package Demons is the default component for pairwise registration, but other registration algorithms should work too.

##  Installing GRAM
####Requirements
1. ITK:  For the package to build properly, you need to have ITK library built with `review` option on. For more information on installing ITK, go to http://www.itk.org/ITK/resources/software.html. The package was test with ITK 3.14.
2. MATLAB:  The package uses MATLAB scripts.  The package uses Matlab Graph Library (http://www.stanford.edu/~dgleich/programs/matlab_bgl) and NIFTI toolbox (http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/~jimmy/NIfTI), which are freeware. These toolboxes are included in the package. The package was tested with MATLAB R2009B, but it will probably work with older versions as well. 
3. CMake: CMake (http://www.cmake.org) is used create cross-platform makefiles.  
4. Compiler and linker for Windows:  You can use the freeware version of Visual Studio (http://www.microsoft.com/express/). The package was test with Visual Studio 2008 Express.

####Operating Systems
The package was tested on linux and Windows XP.

####Folder Structure
1. Code
  1.	Core: Core algorithms
  2.	ITK: ITK library
  3.	matlab_bgl: Matlab library for graph theoretic algorithms
  4.	NIFTI: Matlab library for manipulating medical images in NIFTI formats
2. Demo: 
  1.	subject: example dataset of 2D brain patches
  2.	result: intermediate and final registration results of the demo dataset will be saved here
3. Doc: documents 

####Installation
1.	Building ITK-dependent binaries  (linux)
  1.	Install ITK with the `review` option on. Skip this step if ITK is already in the system.
  2.	Go to `GRAMROOT/Code/ITK` , where `GRAMROOT` is the path for the package.
  3.	Create ITK binary directory by `mkdir bin`
  4.	Go to ITK binary directory by `cd bin` 
  5.	Run `ccmake ..`. Configure, accept warnings, configure and generate makefiles.
  6.	Build by `make`, this will generate following binaries in the bin folder. 
    `ConcatenateFields`, `WarpImage`, `JacobianField`, `DemonsRegistration_dong`, `DemonsRegistration_dong_n`
  Please check that the binaries are built without errors. 
  7.	Set environmental variables for your shell. If you use bash, type
    `gedit $HOME/.bashrc` and insert `PATH=$PATH:GRAMROOT/Code/ITK/bin` at the end. If you use csh, type
    `gedit $HOME/.cshrc` and insert 
    `setenv PATH ${PATH}:GRAMROOT/Code/ITK/bin` at the end. 
    Save and exit.
  8.	To apply this change in the shell, either type bash (or csh) or log-in again. To check the path is correctly included, type `DemonsRegistration_dong` in the shell. If you see a list of arguments and help texts, you are all set. If not, check the path again.


2.	Building ITK-dependent binaries  (MS Windows 32bit)
  1.	Install ITK with the `review` option on. Skip this step if ITK is already in the system.
  2.	Go to `GRAMROOT/Code/ITK`, where `GRAMROOT` is the path for the package.
  3.	Create ITK binary directory by `mkdir bin`
  4.	Launch `cmake-gui.exe` and set the source dir as `GRAMROOT/Code/ITK`  and set the bin dir as `GRAMROOT/Code/ITK/bin`
  5.	Configure and generate solution files for Visual Studio. 
  6.	Launch Visual Studio and build the solution in Release mode. This will generate following binaries.
    `ConcatenateFields`, `WarpImage`, `JacobianField`, `DemonsRegistration_dong`, `DemonsRegistration_dong_n`  Please check that the binaries are built without errors.
  7.	Set environment variables: go to `My Computer->Properties->Advanced->Environment Variables-> User variables`.  Add `GRAMROOT\Code\ITK\bin\Release` to the `PATH` variable.
  8.	To check the path is correctly included, open command prompt and type `DemonsRegistration_dong`. If you see a list of arguments and help texts, you are all set. If not, check the path again.

3.	Including Matlab Libraries (OS-independent)  
  Launch MATLAB and include the three folders in the Matlab path:
  ```
  GRAMROOT/Code/Core
  GRAMROOT/Code/matlab_bgl
  GRAMROOT/Code/NIFTI
  ```

## Testing GRAM 
The script `GRAMROOT/Code/Core/test_GRAM.m` demonstrates the usage of GRAM for groupwise registration of medical images. For testing purpose, simulated 2D brain patches are included in the package.  

Before running `test_GRAM.m`, open it in MATLAB by typing `edit test_GRAM.m`. You need to change the following directories in the script to your installation folder:
  ```
  %% Directories
  dirSubject = 'GRAMROOT/Demo/subject';
  dirResult = 'GRAMROOT/Demo/result/geo';
  dirDirectResult = 'GRAMROOT/result/direct';
  ```
Parameters for the algorithms can be changed. Please refer to `GRAM.m` or type `help GRAM.m`. For now, accept the default parameters in the script:
  ```
  %% Parameter
  w = .75;
  NNiter = '15x10x5';
  NNsmoothing = '1.5';
  Fineiter = '5';
  Finesmoothing = '1.5';
  Directiter = '15x10x10';
  Directsmoothing = '1.5';
  ```

Type `test_GRAM` to run the script. This will take less than an hour to finish. If youâ€™re connected via SSH and is automatically disconnected sooner than an hour,  try launching Matlab in the background by typing `matlab &` before starting. No user input is required for `test_GRAM.m`. When the script has finished running without error, you will see the following four figures.

GRAM Result: These are 60 images registered to a W-shaped template by GRAM method.

Diffeomorphic Demon Result: These are 60 images registered to the same template using Demons method directly. Compare this figure with the figure above.

2. test function: `test_GRAM.m`  
  a. Below is the description of `test_GRAM.m` inside the code.
  
    ```
    % This script is a demonstration of GRAM framework. It shows the usage of function  GRAM.m
    % for groupwise registration of simulated 2D images resembling cortical patches. 
    %
    % To run this script with default parameters, change the directories to fit your downloaded folder.
    % It is recommended that the path names do not include spaces.
    % After changing the directories, run test_GRAM.m. The script runs in less than an hour on a PC
    % without user actions. This will output four figures, whose description is
    % in the text.
    %
    % To use GRAM.m for other image databases, the directories and the parameters need
    % to be set properly. Descriptions of the directories and the parameters can be found by typing
    % help GRAM, or by looking into the GRAM.m function.
